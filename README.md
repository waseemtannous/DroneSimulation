# DroneSimulation

Learned about Unity.
Created a 3D environment in Unity to replicate a room and a drone object that moves in the environment.
Added integration for WASD keys to move the drone object in the environment. Any variation of the keys can be used to move the drone object.
Started looking at the djitello python library to integrate with Unity and look for the commands it sends to replicate them.
